# SRZGTimeCalculator
## Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity Calculator
made by arielus05

## the purpose:
    - to make it a bit easier to add up all your track times for story mode and
    - present the information in an easy and readable way

## instructions:
1. extract SRZGTimeCalc.zip
2. double click and run launch_program.bat
3. follow instructions on command prompt

## notes:
1. this program is **open-source** (SRZGTimeCalc.java)
    - **javadoc** (SRZGTimeCalc.html) documenting every field/method in the program if you are curious
    - the **SRZGTimeCalc.java** ofc (source code)
    - misc. stuff in the srcSRZGCalc folder
2. every time the program is run, times.txt **resets** to being blank
3. idk what else to add here :v

ill add more functionality to this program in the future
**PLEASE** tell me if there are any errors/crashes/logic issues that occur while running the program
