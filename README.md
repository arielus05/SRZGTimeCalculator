3. extract the zip file
4. double click and run launch_program.bat
5. follow instructions on command prompt

## notes:
1. this program is **open-source**
2. the **javadoc** (SRZGTimeCalc.html) has every field/method documented in the program
3. every time the program is run, times.txt **resets** to being blank

## WIP/ideas:
1. track time editing
2. livesplit integration (read off screen to grab IGT that way)
